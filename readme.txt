Steps:-
=================================
1. Create database "lara_login".
2. Change 'url' from app/config/app.php.
3. Now in browser visit your url.
	ex:- In my case, its http://localhost/Laravel/CRUD
4. For default route in route define URL::get('/').
	- Here, my default route is like this  "Route::get('/', 'HomeController@showWelcome');".
	- It will call showWelcome function of HomeController which renders index.php file as view.
5. For any further queries, mail me at harshdoshi999@gmail.com.

- Have a lara day!
